      Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me

I am Ji Chengzhi, currently pursuing a Master's degree at University of Chinese Academy of Sciences ([UCAS](https://english.ucas.ac.cn/)), Institute of Software, Chinese Academy of Sciences ([ISCAS](http://english.is.cas.cn/)), under the supervision of Senior Engineer Zhou Xin. My research focuses on advanced artificial intelligence (AI) and radio technologies, dedicated to utilizing deep learning for intelligent analysis of radio signals.

<!-- Prior to joining UCAS, I graduated from Zhejiang University ([ZJU](https://www.zju.edu.cn/english/main.psp)) with a Bachelor's degree, primarily engaged in research on bioinformatics and biostatistics. My undergraduate thesis centered on multi-trait association analysis methods based on generalized linear mixed models (GLMM). Additionally, I participated in transgenic research, employing virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) and CRISPR technologies to explore the impact of the strigolactone (SL) signal regulator D53 on tomato plant growth.

My academic experience spanning the fields of biological sciences and information technology has equipped me with a unique interdisciplinary perspective and research capabilities. I look forward to continuing to delve deeply into the intersecting areas of artificial intelligence (AI) technology, dedicating myself to technological innovation research. -->
